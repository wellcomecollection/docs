# Reference number with another field 

## Expectations:

*	User searches for known item by reference number along with {contributor} {keywords} {workType} {genre} {date} {fuzzy date} to refine search
*	Users expect works with exact match for reference number and matches for other information to appear first in results. 
*	Works that mention the reference number in other fields should follow the exact match in the search results 


## Example: 

*	PP/CRI DNA sketch
