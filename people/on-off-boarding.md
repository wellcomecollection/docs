# What to do when somebody joins/leaves the team

When somebody leaves the team, here's a (probably incomplete) checklist of things we need to think about:

- [ ] Adding them to <https://wellcomecollection.org/humans.txt> (if they're happy to be credited)
- Sort out the following accounts/services
  - [ ] Slack (D&T) add to software required list in the New Starter Request form or raise a ticket with the service desk
  - [ ] Our GitHub organisation (ask a Dev)
  - [ ] Our Buildkite organisation (ask a Dev)
  - [ ] Prismic (ask Digital Editorial team)
  - [ ] Vercel (Dev)
  - [ ] Elastic Cloud (Dev)
  - [ ] Gitbook (Ashley Ray)
  - [ ] Notion (Pete Doherty, Kristine Nielsen, Isabelle Foss, Al Cowie-Fraser)
  - [ ] Mailtrap (Dev)
  - [ ] Miro (and if leaving confirm where to transfer their boards) (Ask Natalie or Hannh or add/remove DE Team users)
  - [ ] Hotjar
  - [ ] Segment

- Other accounts/services that may be required for Platform team members
  - [ ] Gsuite (D&T)
  - [ ] Dovetail (User Researcher)
  - [ ] [Figma](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LumfFcEMKx4gYXKAZTQ/s/MaQacfH9yAJ0HD9VdSNQ/a-z-of-tools/figma)
  - [ ] Trello (D&T)
  - [ ] Email lists (D&T) request in new starter request form
  - [ ] SharePoint site (Sharepoint site owner) e.g. Wellcome Collection, Digital Engagement, Digital Experience sites
- [ ] Make sure their C_ cloud account (i.e. AWS access) is sorted by D&T. When somebody leaves, these accounts aren't removed immediately; they're disabled and deleted after a certain period has passed.
