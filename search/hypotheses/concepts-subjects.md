# Concepts and subjects

## Expectations:

*	Users expect search to be able to locate works about a concept/subject 
*	Users expect search to also deliver works that are conceptually similar or items related to the search term; for example, in the case of beer, also beer bottles, labels, breweries
*	Users expect a search for a subject to be the first results
*	These types of keyword searches may coincide with controlled vocabularies (LCSH, MeSH, LC Genres, other thesauri that users know)


## Examples:

*	Beer
*	funerary urn
*	hms beagle deckplan
*	syphilis images
*	Spanish flu
*	Royal Astronomical Society
*	cholera, london, patient
*	Colour vision defects
