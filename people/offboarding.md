# What to do when somebody leaves the team

When somebody leaves the team, here's a (probably incomplete) checklist of things we need to do:

- [ ] Move them to alumni on <https://wellcomecollection.org/humans.txt>
- Remove them from the following accounts/services
  - [ ] Our GitHub organisation
  - [ ] Our Buildkite organisation
  - [ ] Prismic
  - [ ] Vercel
  - [ ] Elastic Cloud
  - [ ] Gitbook
  - [ ] Notion
- [ ] Make sure their C_ cloud account (i.e. AWS access) is disabled by D&T. These accounts aren't removed immediately; they're disabled and deleted after a certain period has passed.
