# Hypotheses

We are hypothesising patterns of behaviour that a user exhibits when they actively and knowingly search for a concept or an object. For the purpose of analysing intent, we should focus our attention on active, rather than passive search queries.

Active queries are those where the user types words into the search box; the same user may go on to retype the query in different ways, or use search filters to narrow down the set of results.

Passive queries are those that are generated when a user uses pre-formatted, clickable tags/links to navigate to more content of that type. 

## Why make the distinction? 

Users approach a search box with a pre-formed idea of what they’re trying to achieve. That idea might be vague: the user wants to find out if we have something on this single topic area. Or it might be more complex in nature. Regardless of the approach, they are all using words of their own making and intent.

When using tags/links that are offered up by the user interface, users are taking a serendipitous route to a destination; they didn’t choose to search those words, but they’re using the link to navigate and explore. This doesn’t show the same intent as formulating one’s own search. 

As our aim is to improve the search functionality on wellcomecollection.org, it’s crucial that we focus on matching user inputs to their expectation of search outputs.

## Qualitative research 

These intents have been established through our own and other scholarly published research on search behaviour.

For experienced researchers and taught students, defining the end of a search process (i.e. searching a set of keywords on a single site) and defining when they have enough research is very hard to define - they don’t necessarily know until they know. It’s a feeling and is probably affected by things like mood on the day.

Search sessions are complex. Users often switch ‘modes’ of searching between subjects (they might know well or less well) to known item searches and back. Additionally, users will often be using or switching between multiple research sites at once. (Library personas research, 2015)

## Search scenarios

### Scenario 1: What do you have about...?

An exploratory searcher is not searching for a known item. They are searching, for example, for subjects, organisations, movements, objects, people and author/artist. They are likely to be interested in a specific time period; for example, the use of tear gas between 1920 and 1935. They may also approach us with a vague and specific request: “where are your books about medical training”? Someone searching in this mode typically wants to know everything that we hold that matches their criteria, although they might only be interested in a subset of our collection (e.g. archives, manuscripts, images), and so may wish to exclude everything else before seeing results. Anyone new to a topic or library starts this way, even experienced researchers.

Goal: Find the totality of material in the catalogue that match the mixed criteria.


### Scenario 2: Do you have this?

A targeted searcher wants to check whether we have a particular item or collection. This user will likely have some details, either a full citation from a reading list, or recollected information about an item. They are likely to want to see the physical or digital copy, and might be preparing for their next visit or already in the library

Goal: Check for an item that we hold in the catalogue​ and access it.


### Scenario 3: I know you have this.

A targeted searcher is looking for a specific item, normally following a citation or previous use. This user uses what they know about the item to locate it. This type of search is more likely to include reference numbers (collection, system, references, accession numbers, etc), but most often starts with a mix of title and contributor.

Goal: Locate specific details relating to this item, so I can verify information or share it with others. 


### Scenario 4: I’m looking for something that looks like this…

A searcher is looking for representations of real-world concepts. We’re likely to see this type of scenario when a user is trying to find images to illustrate an idea, or to narrow down to items that have specific physical characteristics or visual qualities.

Look for: 
* Physical nature: marginalia, illustrations, annotations, signatures, binding style, patterns
* Visual nature: specific photographic or imaging media (e.g. x-ray, photographic slides)
* Colours
* Emotions, moods

Note: we haven’t seen too much evidence of this in the search logs but it has come up in interviews. In the physical building, this might look like a user browsing old medical journals to compare medical illustration over time; this might not manifest itself in a search query.

Goal: Find a variety of images or items that have a specific quality or characteristic.


### Scenario 5: I’m not sure what I’m looking for but I’ll know it when I see it.

Users in this scenario are typically in the early stage of their research, attempting to see the breadth of material available and to see whether the institution’s collections generally match their assumed needs. The search box is a potential entry point in the absence of any browse functionality. Search behaviour then likely mimics Scenario 1 where the user is not searching for known items, but instead trying to get a feel for the collection. This scenario is better served by browse features, including subject, genre, topic tags; and aggregation pages.

Goal: Explore categories to get a feel for what’s available
