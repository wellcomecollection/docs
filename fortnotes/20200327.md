# Experience
## Done
- The result of the A/B test on a simplified digitised content component on /works pages is that we’ve now switched to the B state because users appear to be more inclined to click to view with the new buttons [#4977](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/4977)
- In releasing the above, Asian manuscripts are now also available on /works
- Online requesting is now available behind a toggle (if you have a Cognito account) [#5132](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5132) / [#5133](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5132), with components added to Cardigan [#5193](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5193)
- We’ve been putting in groundwork for 100% remote testing now that in-person testing is not possible [#5172](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5172)
- We’ve been been creating an annotated version of the Collections pages (search page, works page, works viewer page specifically) to help consolidate what the different components are called, giving them a really simplified description/purpose, and also thinking about how Cardigan can be improved with this information in the future. This will help to make sure we’re all using the same terminology/speaking the same language when referencing the components in conversations [#5181](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5181)
- There is now a dashboard available where people can look at the Digital Engagement departmental indicators [#5143](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5143)
- Single images can be downloaded from the view [#4938](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/4938)

# Data
## Done
-	Created a structure for adding data-science modules to the pipeline, which will infer new data about existing works and images [#4373](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/platform/issues/4373)
-	Added a module to the Images pipeline which describes images’ features, allowing people to discover visually similar material [#4344](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/platform/issues/4344)
-	Ongoing work to allow collections to be explored in the API [#489](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue/pull/489), [#496](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue/pull/496), [#481](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue/pull/481)


## Focusing on next
