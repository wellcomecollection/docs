# Boosting

Boosting works by taking words or “tokens" used in the query and locating these amongst the tokens contained in fields. Matching criteria return a higher or “boosted” test score than other matched fields. Search results are ordered by descending test scores.

Example

{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query" : "oil painting of urine",
      "fields" : ["*", "subjects*^4", "genres*^4", "title^3"],
      "type": "cross_fields"
    }
  }
}
