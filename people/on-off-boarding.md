# What to do when somebody joins/leaves the team

When somebody leaves the team, here's a (probably incomplete) checklist of things we need to think about:

- [ ] Adding them to <https://wellcomecollection.org/humans.txt>
- Sort out the following accounts/services
  - [ ] Our GitHub organisation
  - [ ] Our Buildkite organisation
  - [ ] Prismic
  - [ ] Vercel
  - [ ] Elastic Cloud
  - [ ] Gitbook
  - [ ] Notion
- [ ] Make sure their C_ cloud account (i.e. AWS access) is sorted by D&T. When somebody leaves, these accounts aren't removed immediately; they're disabled and deleted after a certain period has passed.
