# What to do when somebody leaves the team

When somebody leaves the team, here's a (probably incomplete) checklist of things we need to do:

- [ ] Move them to alumni on <https://wellcomecollection.org/humans.txt>
- [ ] Remove them from our GitHub organisation
- [ ] Remove them from our Buildkite organisation
- [ ] Remove them from Prismic, if they had access
- [ ] Make sure their C_ cloud account (i.e. AWS access) is removed by D&T
