## Current [search relevance tests](https://docs.wellcomecollection.org/catalogue/search_relevance/tests)
- AND: Takes the query, splits it into tokens on whitespace, and creates an AND query to match across multiple fields. e.g. ‘Heart starvation’ would only match works that had ‘heart’ AND ‘starvation’ in one of the searchable fields e.g. title, description etc
- Scoring tiers: Queries against different features of the data, such as title or contributors, differently. We then boost these accordingly to make sure more relevant works are surfaced first, and more loosely relevant works are included further down in the results.
