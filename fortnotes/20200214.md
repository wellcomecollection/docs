# Experience team
## Done
-	*Draft* site map completed, to help with the move of Library web site content into wc.org. It’s linked to on [#4966](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/4966)
-	Licence information on works pages is now all coming only from one place [#5064](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5064)
-	We’ve improved the image-only search results, now using a modal window for displaying clicked-on items [#5066](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5066), and with some explainer text for the visually similar images [#5081](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5081)
-	In preparation for adding physical location information to work page, we've replaced the preview area on the work page, with an 'available online' section. The new section is more robust for displaying the various work types available in the catalogue, provides a more consistent experience between the work types and will sit better with the physical locations we will soon be displaying. The change has also reduced the number of API requests needed to render the page and so should help speed up the page load time.  [#5093](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5093)
-	After weeks of testing, we’re removing the search results relevance ranker from search results by default, due to low usage. It’s still going to be available behind a toggle [#4975](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/4975)
