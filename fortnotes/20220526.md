## Done
-	Fixed an accessibility issue [#7997](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/pull/7997)
-	Reduced page weight added by images [#7976](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/7976)
-	Requesting: made date select available behind the Enables pick up date functionality toggle [#7961](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/pull/7961)
-	Made the decision to use GA4 when Universal Analytics sunsets [#7959](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/7959)
-	Update the featured stories ID to "The Roots of a Scientist" [#7999](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/pull/7999)
-	Use Inter font on the web site [#8009](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/pull/8009). The benefits are:<br>
    **Performance**
    -	Loading Inter is only one network request rather than two for for Helvetica regular/bold
    -	File size is 34kb down from 224kb for Helvetica<br>
    **UX**
    -	Helvetica was responsible for a lot of visual jank – the page would load, then we’d have to wait for the font to load before re-aligning a lot of elements
    -	Inter has been designed for computer screens so there’s improved legibility over Helvetica (and it still has the language and diacritic support that we require)
-	Redirect search.wellcomelibrary.org to wellcomecollection.org [#5533](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/platform/issues/5533)
-	Look up works with items that are unidentified [#442](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue-api/pull/442)
-	Catalogue API crashes if it gets non-numeric input for the 'color' parameter [#5529](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/platform/issues/5529)
-	Store data for the API in an opaque field in the format in which it is served [#5449](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/platform/issues/5449)
-	Add a regression test for the ImageCard component [#8008](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/pull/8008)
