# Experience team
## Done
- Viewer improvements: [prototype](https://d2der.sse.codesandbox.io/) for scrollable main viewing area and thumbnails to match people’s mental models of using a PDF viewer. Just enough images are loaded so it appears seamless and has good performance [#4856](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/4856)
- Second round of wc.org site navigation tree testing analysed; results being used to plan a third round
- We created a date filter to aid the search facility and evaluated its performance.  While it was used by almost everyone, we found significant differences in the amount of preliminary searching prior to filter use.  We are now analysing search behaviours by persona to increase the accuracy of optimisation going forward [#4896](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/4896)
- Second round of Sierra material type labels testing conducted to find out how users describe our material; results now being analysed [#3807](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/3807)
- An item can be requested via an API


# Preservation team
## Done
- Support for CALM IDs in the storage service [#4088](https://github.com/wellcometrust/platform/issues/4088)
- Proven that we can run a single collection through Archivematica [#4067](https://github.com/wellcometrust/platform/issues/4067)
- Exported all catalogued born-digital collections from Preservica

## Focusing on next
- Born digital migration
- Requesting from Library stores


# Data team
## Done
- Image search prototype is available behind the ‘Enable the images-only search option’ [toggle](https://dash.wellcomecollection.org/) after a [search](https://wellcomecollection.org/works) is run. This is to help researchers only looking for images, including images with similar colour palettes [#4079](https://github.com/wellcometrust/platform/issues/4079) 
- Infrastructure for pipeline and adapter configured and deployed
- METS data (digitised status and copyright) can now be used as a source of data [#3921](https://github.com/wellcometrust/platform/issues/3921)
- We can now monitor and optimise search queries to ensure high performance [#4058](https://github.com/wellcometrust/platform/issues/4058)


## Focusing on next
- Digitised status and copyright
- Search relevance

## Current search relevance test:
- Stacked query: Combination of a set of restrictive, highly boosted `AND`s across a few important fields (`should` match), over a loose, permissive, unboosted `OR` query across all other relevant fields (`must` match) [#4060](https://github.com/wellcometrust/platform/issues/4060)
