# Reporting and metrics

### Status: Draft

### TODO

* Define a timeframe for data retention \(should relate to testing as we should be able to make decisions within this timeframe\)

### Objectives

#### Access

**A greater breadth of our collection accessed**

* Decrease in % of catalogue with 0 views
* Greater spread of works viewed across work types

#### Precision

**People with a specific search intentions can have their expectations met**

* **Clicks per search \(CPS\)** is measured passively by tracking users' behaviour while they use the search function. This is a variant of a traditional click through rate \(CTR\), calculated by taking the ratio of the number of items clicked to the number of distinct searches, for each anonymised session id
* **Top n clicks per search \(CPS-n\)** is almost exactly the same as the above, but only counts the clicks on works which appear in the top n results.

**Metrics without a home**
