## Progress against our quarterly objectives

Alongside ongoing improvements, the team revamped the email signup components to enable Wellcome Collectionâ€™s future email strategy. This included a redesign of the bottom-of-the-page component, the addition of a new marketing opt-in, and some small copy updates to reflect our GDPR obligations.

We also had a kickoff with colleagues from Collections Information and Collection Care to initiate a longer-term effort to make offsite and/or manual requests available to request online. More on that to come!
