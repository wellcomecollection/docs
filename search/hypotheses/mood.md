# Mood

## Expectations:

Non-traditional researchers (especially those coming from an artistic frame of reference) may frame their research questions much more abstractly, for example “what have you got that speaks about repression?” or, “I’m interested in how violence is enacted through your collections,” etc. Search may not be the place for this! 


# Examples:

*	Retro vibes
*	Sad boy / sadness kid
*	Tie dye
*	Vintage collages
