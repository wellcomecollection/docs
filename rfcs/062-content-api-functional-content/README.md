# Content API: Functional content search

[Background information](#background-information)

## Background information

The goal with the Content API has always included some level of functional content search being possible. We define "Functional content" as "Visitor Information Content", which represents an array of content types in Prismic. In this RFC, we'll attempt to define which ones they are, how they will be indexed, and which methods we will use to search across them using one endpoint.
