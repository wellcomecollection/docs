# Logbooks

Keeping a logbook can have multiple benefits, both personally and for your career.

Many of the benefits are [outlined clearly in this article](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/), so this document will focus on how they are relevant to Wellcome Collection processes specifically.

## What are they used for

### Your logbook

* Memory fallability machines
* Facilitate discussion in [1-1s](1-1s.md)
* A great reference when discussing promotions or pay raises

### Other's logbooks

* Useful in running through to give effective [feedback](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/docs/tree/9a738c3e5419b986d530a0f3f855f1749e0fec0d/people/feedback/README.md)
* A great chance to remind someone of something they might have left off
