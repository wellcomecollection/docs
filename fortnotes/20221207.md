## Done

### Features
- We've made a first round of improvements to the relevance of our "visually similar image" matches by using some new query features in Elasticsearch 8. Until now we've extracted features from images but have needed to compare an augmented version of them; the new way of doing things allows us to compare those features directly, which should make the results much better! We've also done the research for a second round of improvements, which will polish up the features we extract from images before they're compared. We're also tracking how that feature is used so that we have some quantitative data to monitor over time [#8885](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/issues/8885), [#2236](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue-pipeline/issues/2236), [#113](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/data-science/issues/113)

- Show the search results overview page (first cut)
-	Concepts data snagging
- Implementation of Lambda logging
-	Investigate running apps locally (zones?)
- Use rank to test whether exact phrases always score higher than looser matches
- Iterate on the design of the tabbed navigation to enable A/B testing
- Spike on investigating improving the process for switching off requesting
