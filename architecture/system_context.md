# System Context

This document provides an overview of the [system context](https://c4model.com/diagrams/system-context) for Wellcome Collection's digital services, including the main components, their interactions, and the accounts they reside in.

Here we are using the C4 model to represent the system context at a high level, incorporating the services described in the [Services](./services/README.md) section.
