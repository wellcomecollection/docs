# Reference numbers

## Expectations:

*	Users expect search to be able to locate works by their local and external identifiers eg Catalogue API IDs, Sierra IDs etc and for these to appear first in results 
*	Works that mention the reference number in other fields should come after the exact match
*	Searches should be case-insensitive
*	Users searching for an identifier and other input, should find works matching the identifier and input at the top of the results
*	Note: We have instances where a user may have one alternative version of a reference number that has been referred to as something else, e.g. WMS 682 / MS 682 / MS.682. They are the same item. 


## Examples:

*	L0029993
*	SA/MED/L
*	727416i
*	HALDANE/4/16/1/4 
*	MS PERSIAN 373
*	V1234567
*	V1234567 i1234567 aTrf569
