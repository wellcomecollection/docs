Hypotheses of user expectations and search behaviour are validated by analysis.  Once validated, different query tools are deployed and tested in order to meet these expectations.  

In cases where links to analysis or relevance testing are missing, this work is either pending or redundant. In cases where links to query tools are missing, this query type is served by the tools used for Concepts, subjects.
