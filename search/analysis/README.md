# Analysis

## Analysis of 1-2 word searches

Our Digital Analyst looked at usersâ€™ first search query in a session in order to evaluate search intentions unaffected by results returned. For this reason, subsequent searches were filtered out of the data analysed. Searches attributable to Google and other search engines were also removed from the dataset as the queries in the dataset were the tags that Google search matched and not the actual words typed into Google. Lastly, tags as indicated by quotation marks were removed from consideration as these arise from either links into Stories, social media or bookmarks.

Analysis of 1 and 2 words was conducted on 4,953 searches to validate hypotheses of priority areas for users sampled during the period 30/6/20 - 3/7/20.
