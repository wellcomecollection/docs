## What is an RFC?

Please create an RFC if you have an idea about how to make a big change to the way we do things currently and need a place to share that with your colleagues.

The process of creating an RFC, discussing that RFC in a pull request, amending and merging is important to provide a forum for all to contribute to the platform.

When an RFC is merged it provides a guide to implementing that change when it is useful to do so, or provides context to an [Architecture decision record (ADR) document](../adr/).

## How do I format an RFC?

An RFC is a markdown file in the `rfcs` directory. It should be named with a number and a short description, e.g. `070-concepts-api-changes.md`.
The filename should be prefixed with the next available number in the sequence, and the title of the RFC should match the filename.

The RFC **must** include the following sections:

- **Title:** A short, descriptive title for the RFC, in the format `RFC {number}: {title}`.
- **Last modified:** The date and time the RFC was last modified, in ISO 8601 format (use `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`)
- **Context:** A brief description of the problem or opportunity that the RFC addresses.

The RFC **should** include the following sections:

- **Proposal:** A detailed description of the proposed solution, including any relevant technical details, diagrams, or examples.
- **Alternatives considered:** A discussion of any alternative solutions that were considered, and why they were not chosen.
- **Impact:** A description of the impact of the proposed solution, including any potential risks or challenges.
- **Next steps:** A list of next steps for implementing the proposed solution, including any dependencies or prerequisites.

| RFC ID | Summary | Next Line | Last Modified |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| [083-stable_identifiers](083-stable_identifiers/README.md) | RFC 083: Stable identifiers following mass record migration | This RFC discusses what will happen to public catalogue identifiers following the mass migration of records from CALM/Sierra to Axiell Collection / Folio and how we can update the catalogue pipeline to accommodate this change. | **Last modified:** 2026-02-10T12:00:00+00:00 |
| [080-pipeline-failures](080-pipeline-failures/README.md) | RFC 080: Handling failures in Python Step Functions | Pipeline steps may fail for certain inputs.  Those failures are caught, logged, and retried using a templated recursive state machine defined for each step.  The overall pipeline is thereby kept clean of error handling and can simply describe the happy-path flow of data. | **Last modified:** 2025-12-01T00:00:00Z |
| [079-new-online](079-new-online/README.md) | Showcase recently digitised works on the Collections landing page | This RFC proposes adding a digitisation `createdDate` to catalogue Works and exposing it via the catalogue-api so we can surface “New Online” works, including a dedicated page and an editorialised selection on the Collections landing page. It outlines how the date is extracted from METS, indexed, and made available for filtering and sorting. | **Last modified:** 2025-10-15T10:50:00Z |
| [081-identifiers-in-iiif-builder](081-identifiers-in-iiif-builder/README.md) | RFC 081: Identifiers in iiif-builder: beyond the B number | IIIF-Builder (aka DDS) understands various identifier forms (BNumbers, CALM Reference Numbers and Work IDs), and makes processing decisions based on the form of the identifier. For example, if asked to process a b number, it knows the item _must_ have been processed by Goobi, and it _must_ be in the `digitised` storage service space. These _musts_ will soon no longer be true, and soon there will not even be b numbers. | **Last modified:** 2025-08-15T17:00+00:00 |

| [003-asset_access](003-asset_access/README.md) | RFC 003: Asset Access | This RFC proposes a solution for restricting access to digital assets based on their access provisions and the authentication status of the viewer, while allowing these assets to be served via a CDN. | **Last modified:** 2018-11-02T16:46:57+00:00 |
| [001-merger_matcher](001-merger_matcher/README.md) | RFC 001: Matcher architecture | This RFC proposes an architecture for the matcher and merger components of the reindexer, which are responsible for identifying and merging related works in the catalogue. | **Last modified:** 2018-11-02T16:46:57+00:00 |
| [004-mets_adapter](004-mets_adapter/README.md) | RFC 004: METS Adapter | This RFC proposes a solution for ingesting METS files from the digitisation workflow software Goobi, converting them to JSON, and integrating them into the Wellcome Collection digital catalogue. | **Last modified:** 2018-11-02T16:46:57+00:00 |
| [078-name-reconciliation-service](078-name-reconciliation-service/README.md) | RFC 078: Name Reconciliation Service (NARESE) | This RFC proposes NARESE, a batch-oriented Name Reconciliation Service that uses embedding-based vector similarity search combined with constrained Large Language Model reasoning to identify and cluster variant textual forms of person and agent names in our Works metadata. The service addresses fragmentation caused by different spellings, initials, and date formats (e.g., "John Smith", "J. Smith", "Smith, John (1870-1932)") by producing machine-generated reconciliation clusters with traceable provenance and confidence tiers, prioritizing precision over recall to maintain data quality trust while improving search relevance, faceting, and downstream enrichment capabilities. | **Last modified:**  2025-09-08T17:00+00:00 |
