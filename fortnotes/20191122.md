## Done
- Newsletter promo redesign usage analysis: 90 days of data from the date of the redesign was compared to the previous year. The percentage of sign ups to unique sessions showed a decreased following the redesign, so we are going to iterate first with changing wording, then separating the promo from the footer. Because page design is different on mobile devices, reinstating the position of the sign up button has been prioritised. [#4769](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/4769)
