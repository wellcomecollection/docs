# Experience team
## Done
-	Newsletter promo and page redesigned to encourage more sign-ups. Copy is currently being A/B tested [#2703](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/2703)
-	GE – NEXT 9 [#4788](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/4788)
-	Ephemera made available to /works (in search, filter as format, and view), expanding access to more of our materials [#5047](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/pull/5047)
-	Viewer opens on reading view (instead of overview grid) which is a better starting point as we add in more material with few pages e.g. ephemera [#5026](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5026)
-	Check boxes on search results filters fixed so that the first option in a list doesn’t look like it’s selected [#4983](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/4983)
-	Analysis carried out of the rate of views/searches by session size to test the hypothesis that some users are more discerning than others. This research has sparked a new project analysing the behaviour of users who search only once and possibly excluding their data when evaluating search metrics [#5009](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues/5009)
