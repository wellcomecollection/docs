# Genre with other field

## Expectations:

* User searches for genre along with {concept/subject} {contributor} {keywords} {workType} {date} {fuzzy date} to refine this search
* Users expect works with exact match for reference number and matches for other information to appear first in results. 
* Works that mention the reference number in other fields should follow the exact match in the search results 

## Examples:

* medieval woodcut prints
* Contraception zine - \(a zine with the title 'contraception zine'\)
* Zines + mental health
* Artistsâ€™ books + breast cancer
* Graphic medicine + infertility
* Botany, 16th Century
* Hong kong 1870
* skull engraving
* women + medical schools
* Recipe books + England \(may expect UK as well\)
* Drugs 1960s
