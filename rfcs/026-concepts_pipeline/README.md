# RFC 024: Concepts Pipeline

**Status:** 🏗 Draft 🚧

**Last updated:** 2020/05/20

## Goals

* Being able to query the works index on values from the data derived from the [concepts enricher][concepts-enricher]
* Being able to display data derived from the [concepts enricher][concepts-enricher]

This RFC assumes the way to do this is by feeding data from the concepts index back into the works index.

This RFC explores the benefits and issues with the different ways in which we might achieve this.
