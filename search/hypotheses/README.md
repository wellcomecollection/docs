# Hypotheses

We are hypothesising patterns of behaviour that a user exhibits when they actively and knowingly search for a concept or an object. For the purpose of analysing intent, we should focus our attention on active, rather than passive search queries.

Active queries are those where the user types words into the search box; the same user may go on to retype the query in different ways, or use search filters to narrow down the set of results.

Passive queries are those that are generated when a user uses pre-formatted, clickable tags/links to navigate to more content of that type. 

## Why make the distinction? 

Users approach a search box with a pre-formed idea of what they’re trying to achieve. That idea might be vague: the user wants to find out if we have something on this single topic area. Or it might be more complex in nature. Regardless of the approach, they are all using words of their own making and intent.

When using tags/links that are offered up by the user interface, users are taking a serendipitous route to a destination; they didn’t choose to search those words, but they’re using the link to navigate and explore. This doesn’t show the same intent as formulating one’s own search. 

As our aim is to improve the search functionality on wellcomecollection.org, it’s crucial that we focus on matching user inputs to their expectation of search outputs.

## Qualitative research 

These intents have been established through our own and other scholarly published research on search behaviour.

For experienced researchers and taught students, defining the end of a search process (i.e. searching a set of keywords on a single site) and defining when they have enough research is very hard to define - they don’t necessarily know until they know. It’s a feeling and is probably affected by things like mood on the day.

Search sessions are complex. Users often switch ‘modes’ of searching between subjects (they might know well or less well) to known item searches and back. Additionally, users will often be using or switching between multiple research sites at once. (Library personas research, 2015)
