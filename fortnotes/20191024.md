## Experience team

### Done

* Built a custom pop-up to invite participation in online surveys/tests, so we’re not reliant on varying third-party widgets \(e.g. from Hotjar\). This will be used first for a tree test for wc.org site navigation
* Sort by relevance / date ascending / date descending added to wc.org search results
* More Sierra data, e.g. notes, available for display on the work page behind a toggle
* Prepared for a change in the content management system \(Prismic\) whereby it will provide it’s own image sizing / optimization service as of 28 October

## Preservation team

### Done

* Finished syncing to the DDS/library system
* Finished the automatic testing of migrated items
* The content on the UAT site is being served from the storage service and we are working on a few final issues before making it public on the Library site
* Archivematica now supports updating bags already stored in the storage service, e.g. if you need to edit some metadata

### Focusing on next

* Finish digitised content migration
* Understand the approach for born digital migration
