# Request for comments (RFC)

An RFC is a place to discuss possible changes to the Wellcome Collection platform.

---

Please create an RFC if you have an idea about how to make a big change to the way we do things currently and need a place to share that with your colleagues. 

The process of creating an RFC, discussing that RFC in a pull request, amending and merging is important to provide a forum for all to contribute to the platform. 

When an RFC is merged it provides a guide to implementing that change when it is useful to do so, or provides context to an [Architecture decision record (ADR) document](../adr/README.md).
