## Focusing on next

### Increase access to our collections
-	Offsite requesting:
    -	Move calculating available dates for item requesting to the items API [#741](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue-api/issues/741)
- EBSCO
    - Setup a lambda to receive data from the EBSCO SFTP [#2552](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue-pipeline/issues/2552)
    - Implement a MARCXML transformer
    - Confirm with EBSCO that they can provide the MARCXML where needed
- Restricted access
    - Get confirmation on patron type for accessing restricted content
- Plan library data link explorer work
- Downloadable born digital files
    - Design mobile-view works page
    - Show to collections team
    - Investigate archive tree flexibility (design and dev)
    - Implement designs on works page

### Increase findability across our collections and stories
- Events search
    - Add two filters (available online, location: in our building or online)
    - Bring out from toggle?
    - Plan for how we understand usage 

### Wellcomecollection.org is reliable, efficient and compliant
 - Consent Management Platform solution (cookies)
    - •	Look at Civic UK Pro version from UX / UI design perspective
    - Agree design of banner and preference centre

### Team goal - Product and team vision, goals & priorities are clear & communicate

### Other
- Look at why ByteSpider traffic is still making it to the front end
- Extend load balancer health checks or search API to fail if it can’t connect to ES (including Investigate Elasticsearch timeout can be fatal to the ingestor. [#2268](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue-pipeline/issues/2268))
- Whiteboard session on what could make observability of the pipeline better
- Discuss how we treat images
