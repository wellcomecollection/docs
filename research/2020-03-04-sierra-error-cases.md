# Handling error cases in requesting

## 4 March 2020, Alex Chan and Natalie Pollecutt

**The user clicks "request item", and something goes wrong.**

One source of errors with item requesting is the Sierra API â€“ if it refuses or is unable to place a hold. The requesting service and front-end need to handle this:

* The APIs need to recognise the error, and provide a suitable response.
* The front-end needs to present error messages to users based on responses from the APIs.

This document is an attempt to list all the ways the Sierra API might not place a hold:

* **A server error from Sierra.** The Sierra API returns a 500 error.
* **Sierra is unavailable.** Sierra sometimes goes down for maintenance/upgrades. Our API should handle that correctly \(i.e., not hang forever waiting for a Sierra response\).
* **Handling barred users correctly.** Patron records have an MBLOCK field, which has four possible values:
  * Empty \(the default\)
  * b \(BARRED\) -- anybody who isn't allowed in the library or to request items. These records persist forever. If a barred user tries to request an item on the current site, they get an error:

    > There is a problem with your library record. Please see a librarian.

  * l \(CLUB\) -- a legacy field that stopped existing years ago. It's nothing to do with the library. I don't think we expect to see any users with this field.
  * m \(MESSAGE\) -- so staff can record a message. This stops current users from requesting \(but Natalie was surprised by this\).
* **Handling deleted/expired users correctly.**

  Library cards have an expiry date.

  * After the expiry date passes, the patron is no longer able to make requests. They get a generic error message if they try to request an item on the current site:

    > There is a problem with your library record. Please see a librarian.

  * If the card has been expired for a while, the patron is moved to `P TYPE=expired` in Sierra
  * If the patron sits in that state for even longer, the patron record is deleted entirely \(unless the patron is barred\)

  We should be able to handle this correctly:

  * If the API is asked to place a hold for an expired user, it gives an appropriate error message \(maybe surfacing this information in the UI\)
  * If the API is asked to place a hold for a deleted user, it gives an appropriate error message
  * If a patron's account expires and then they renew their card, they can place holds again

* **Hitting the patron hold limit.**

  The current hold limit is 20; if a patron has already placed holds on 20 items, they cannot place another hold.

  Cases to consider:

  * The patron is at \(or above?\) their hold limit
  * If the patron is at their hold limit, then cancels a hold and places a new hold, the hold should succeed

  Questions:

  * Is the hold limit configurable, on a per-user/per-library basis?
  * Is it possible to go above the hold limit using Sierra jiggery-pokery?

* **An item is already on hold.**
  * If Alice has a hold on an item, and tries to place a second hold on it, we should handle that in the API and present a sensible message in the UI
  * If Alice has a hold on an item, Bob should not be able to place a hold on the same item \(or get any information about Alice\)
* **An item is not available to be requested.**

  The rules about whether an item can be requested are based on _Sierra loan rule tables_, and this dictates whether a button appears in the current UI.

  * Suppressed and deleted items don't appear at all. \(The API should still handle requests to hold them, e.g. if a user leaves a tab open, and the item is suppressed or deleted in the meantime.\)
  * Items on loan to somebody else \(e.g. staff members\)
  * Items in a location that means they're not requestable \(e.g. an inter-library loan\)
