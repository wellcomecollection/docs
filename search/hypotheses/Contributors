# Expectations:

*	Users expect search to locate works by or about a person/organisation
*	Users expect search results to return a list of contributor with an exact or close-enough name match
*	Users expect works by that contributor to be grouped together
*	Users expect search text with the exact name of an author should return their works or works they have contributed towards as first results
*	Where there are multiple contributors with similar names, creation date may be used as secondary criteria to disambiguate, but this doesn’t cover cases where a work was published posthumously
*	Inclusion of titles, honorifics and middle names/initials can pose problems when we’re tuning for precision over recall


# Examples:

*	Frederic Cayley Robinson
*	Levasseur
*	Ursula Philip
*	Royal Astronomical Society
*	A K JOHNSON
