*	User searches for contributor along with {title phrase} {keywords} {workType} {genre} {date} {fuzzy date} to refine this search. 
*	Users expect all contributor+ matches to be grouped together instead of spread across many pages; to look at them as a set 
*	Users expect search text that matches/partially matches well-known titles combined with another search term should improve their search results
*	Returns matches at top of results
