# Expectations:

*	Experienced searchers use special characters or regular expressions to make searches more powerful.


# Examples:

*	Use quote marks to isolate a phrase 
*	Assume quotemarks take priority over ANDing a string of terms 
*	Wildcard with the intention of picking up plurals (*)
*	Substitute ? in the middle of a word to find spelling variants (e.g. wom?n for women, woman, womyn, womxn)
*	Combine searches for specificity. (Archivist: “at the moment I can use the reference + other terms to find specific things within a collection, but that's not intuitive to users”)
*	Narrow a search by adding more words to make search more specific
*	Implies Boolean AND
