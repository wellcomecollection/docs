## Analysis of causes

Expected change to not need a reindex, single PR didn’t, but deployment of master had more there than in the single PR.

The commit had a green tick so looked fine.

Fields added to internal model did need the reindex. Because that reindex hadn’t happened it caused the API to fall over.

Integration tests started failing Tue 26 January https://wellcome.slack.com/archives/C018ELHJVFE/p1611861071000400

This wasn’t seen so didn’t know there was an issue. Integration tests are in wc-platform-builds channel. Had been moved out of wc-platform because they were too noisy.


## Actions

**JP** Have build badges in Build Kite for:
- the main build 
- integration tests - https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue/pull/1328 

**AC** Reduce frequency of alerts so that it alerts:

- When state changes
- https://github.com/wellcomecollection/platform/issues/5000

**AC** Move the alert into wc-platform-alerts

**AFC** Write RFC about internal model versioning and decoupling API and pipeline https://github.com/wellcomecollection/platform/issues/4998
