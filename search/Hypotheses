#Exploring

An exploratory searcher is not searching for a known item. They are searching, for example, for subjects, organisations, movements, objects, people and author/artist. 

They are likely to be interested in a specific time period; for example, the use of tear gas between 1920 and 1935. They may also approach us with a vague and specific request: “where are your books about medical training”? Someone searching in this mode typically wants to know everything that we hold that matches their criteria, although they might only be interested in a subset of our collection (e.g. archives, manuscripts, images), and so may wish to exclude everything else before seeing results. 

Anyone new to a topic or library starts this way, even experienced researchers.

Goal: Find the totality of material in the catalogue that match the mixed criteria.
