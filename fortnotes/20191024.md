# Experience team
## Done
- Built a custom pop-up to invite participation in online surveys/tests, so we’re not reliant on varying third-party widgets (e.g. from Hotjar). This will be used first for a tree test for wc.org site navigation
- Sort by relevance / date ascending / date descending added to wc.org search results
- More Sierra data, e.g. notes, available for display on the work page behind a toggle
- Prepared for a change in the content management system (Prismic) whereby it will provide it’s own image sizing / optimization service as of 28 October


# Preservation team
## Done
- Finished syncing to the DDS/library system
- Finished the automatic testing of migrated items
- The content on the UAT site is being served from the storage service and we are working on a few final issues before making it public on the Library site
- Archivematica now supports updating bags already stored in the storage service, e.g. if you need to edit some metadata

## Focusing on next
- Finish digitised content migration
- Understand the approach for born digital migration
