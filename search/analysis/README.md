# Analysis

Our Digital Analyst looked at usersâ€™ first search query in a session to surface basic search intentions and prioritise areas for development.  In order to evaluate search intentions unaffected by results returned, subsequent searches were filtered out of the data analysed. Searches attributable to Google and other search engines were removed from the dataset as the queries in the dataset were the tags that Google search matched and not the actual words typed into Google. 

Analysis of search queries including subsequent searches forms the basis for provision of more sophisticated search functionality. Users who use search 3 times or more develop expectations of what Wellcome Collection is able to provide resulting in more specialised combinations of terms and parameters.
