# RFC 076: Enriching catalogue API data from the knowledge graph

Draft

[GitHub issue](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/platform/issues/6047)

## Related works
We wanted to document some of the current logic currently in use on the Front-End. The current implementation is a temporary one while the component is being tested and improved upon, and so it is likely to change. Those changes will also be documented. We thought it was relevant to document it here as its final solution will very probably benefit from this work. Feel free to completely restructure this, or to move it elsewhere when you get to tackling this RFC.
