# Progress against our quarterly objectives
## Digital Experience
### Born-digital collection is available to the public
- Collections and digital stakeholders met to review user needs in relation to our MVP born-digital solution and agreed next steps
 
### Improve experience for users with access needs pre and during visit
- Designed a new UX flow to address pain points in the user experience/journey of our digital exhibition guides. These guides allow exhibition visitors to access a highlight tour (audio or BSL videos with transcripts), plus all the exhibition text, on their own devices.
 
### Wellcomecollection.org handles user data in a compliant and transparent way
- From Tuesday (4th June) all website visitors are being presented with our new cookie consent banner. This gives our users more transparency and the option to manage their cookie preferences. This means that from this point on we will be capturing a smaller proportion of user activity data eg. through Google Analytics.

### Build the strongest foundations possible for the Wellcome Design System to succeed
- The team investigated naming of design tokens and progressed work towards an MVP design system which could be used by product teams across both Trust and Collection.

## Digital Platform
### Expand and reinforce our digital preservation capabilities
- Initial discovery relating to 869 corporate photography shoots with a view to automating their ingest: [Ingest corporate archive images](https://www.notion.so/Ingest-corporate-archive-images-09d2b2fc47b846a0a377900a6c7e386d?pvs=21)

### Improve access to our collections for staff and users
- Off-site requesting, next steps articulated to support the requesting of off-site items held at Deepstore [#783](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue-api/issues/783)
 
### Ensure that e-resource data is accurate and supports effective discovery
- Further refinements to EBSCO data, this transformer is now complete and we are displaying data directly from EBSCO
