# Reporting and metrics

### Status: Draft

### Objectives

#### Exploration

**A greater breadth of our collection accessed**

* Decrease in % of catalogue with 0 views
* Greater spread of works viewed across work types

#### Precision

**People with a specific search intentions can have their expectations met**

* **Clicks per search \(CPS\)** is measured passively by tracking users' behaviour while they use the search function. This version of CTR is different to the usual definition; we take the ratio of the number of distinct searches to the number of items clicked on for each anonymised session id.
* **Top n clicks per search \(CPS5\)** is almost exactly the same as the above, but only counts the clicks on works which appear in the top n results.
