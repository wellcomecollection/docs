# Feedback

> [Giving feedback turns out to be the unnatural atomic building block atop which the unnatural skill set of management gets built](https://a16z.com/2012/10/17/making-yourself-a-ceo/)

Feedback is important to maintain a shared understanding of what is going well and what needs improvement.

It promotes sharing of ideas on how to maintain and develop a shared understanding into impactful action.

It is an integral part of any iteratively improving system - including products, processes, and people.

## Where will feedback be used

Feedack will be used

* To discuss anything that has come up between 1:1s 
* To facilitate running through and creating PDRs each quarter
* As evidence for promotion applications

## In what format do we collect feedback

What happened, what impact did it have, and how might we respond to it, AKA: [Behaviour, Impact, Challenge](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm). [You can find some good examples here](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/).

We should be thinking about both what was achieved and how it was achieved.

Feedback is often given to reinforce a behaviour, or to change a behavior.

### Behaviours / observations

Factual observations of a person's actions.

**Reinforcement e.g:** You explained the piece of work you were starting clearly and transparently

**Change e.g:** You worked on alone for a week on the new piece of work you started

### Impact

How this affected the product or people involved

**Reinforcement e.g:** Valuable contributions were made from some teams, all parties felt included, and the end result needed little refinement.

**Change e.g:** Some contributions from the other teams weren't included and we had to make a significant changes to the original implementation. It made other teams feel less involved in the outcome of the product.

## Challenge

How we move towards changing or facilitating this to have a more favourable outcome?

**Reinforcement e.g:** Could you share how you did this with the rest of the team?

**Change e.g:** Was there a reason you started without including others?

## What do we collect feedback on?

Areas that feedback is useful to help a person improve are:

### The product

[You can see the product roadmap here](https://roadmap.wellcomecollection.org/tabs/1-planned).

* What impact have you had on the products?
* How can we better support you to contribute meaningfully towards the product?

### Process

* How do you work within the current processes?
* How have you impacted the processes we currently use?
* How can we better support you to work within and contribute towards the processes we use?

### Personal

* How are you developing yourself?
* How can we support your personal growth within the organisation.

## Team / people

* How are you impacting those around you?

## When do we go through the feedback

As timely as possible making the feedback as easy as possible to act and respond to, but with regards to the fact that receiving feedback too often will cause a numbness to it, probably reduce the quality of it, and miss the opportunity to see patterns forming.

This will be initially be done every month, or in the context of fortnightly 1:1s, every second occurrence.
