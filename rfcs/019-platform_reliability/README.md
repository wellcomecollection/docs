## Overview / background

Following on from a review of current reliability issues, here is aggregated what was discussed into some proposals for action.

The discussion split into 3 major areas:

* [Observability](observability.md): Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting.
* [Reliability](reliability.md): Acceptance/Integration testing in the catalogue pipeline and the front-end.
