## What is an RFC?

Please create an RFC if you have an idea about how to make a big change to the way we do things currently and need a place to share that with your colleagues.

The process of creating an RFC, discussing that RFC in a pull request, amending and merging is important to provide a forum for all to contribute to the platform.

When an RFC is merged it provides a guide to implementing that change when it is useful to do so, or provides context to an [Architecture decision record (ADR) document](../adr/).

## How do I format an RFC?

An RFC is a markdown file in the `rfcs` directory. It should be named with a number and a short description, e.g. `070-concepts-api-changes.md`.
The filename should be prefixed with the next available number in the sequence, and the title of the RFC should match the filename.

The RFC **must** include the following sections:

- **Title:** A short, descriptive title for the RFC, in the format `RFC {number}: {title}`.
- **Last modified:** The date and time the RFC was last modified, in ISO 8601 format (use `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`)
- **Context:** A brief description of the problem or opportunity that the RFC addresses.

The RFC **should** include the following sections:

- **Proposal:** A detailed description of the proposed solution, including any relevant technical details, diagrams, or examples.
- **Alternatives considered:** A discussion of any alternative solutions that were considered, and why they were not chosen.
- **Impact:** A description of the impact of the proposed solution, including any potential risks or challenges.
- **Next steps:** A list of next steps for implementing the proposed solution, including any dependencies or prerequisites.
