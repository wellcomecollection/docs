# buildkite_stack

## Architecture

The infrastructure for our CI/CD pipelines, which uses Buildkite to run agents on AWS. This stack is designed to scale and manage the lifecycle of Buildkite agents, allowing for efficient continuous integration and deployment processes.

The architecture is described in the Buildkite Elastic CI Stack for AWS, which provides a CloudFormation template to set up the necessary resources.
