# Intentions & Expectations

Searching for an known title within the catalogue

* When the exact title is searched for, it is the first result
* If it is a partial match of the title, it is the first result

**Thoughts & questions**

* Fuzziness
* Works mentioning the title
* Examples

Searching for a specific featureðŸŽµ within our catalogue

* When the exact feature is searched for, all works containing that

  feature are surfaced

* When a partial feature is searched for, all works that contain the

  portion searched are surfaced

**Thoughts & questions**

* When partial searches are done, how do prioritise order?

  i.e searching for `Quack` on `Quacks Europe` or `Duck quacks`

* How do we prioritise partial vs complete matches?

  i.e. searching for `Medicine` on `Medicine` or `Medicine man`

ðŸŽµ Features in our case are concepts, which can be generic concepts, people, places, or organisation.
