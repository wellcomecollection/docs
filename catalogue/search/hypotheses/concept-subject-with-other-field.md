# Concepts, subject, and another field

## Expectations:

*	User searches for concept or subject along with {concept/subject} {contributor} {keywords} {format} {genre} {date} {fuzzy date} to refine this search
*	Users expect works with exact match for reference number and matches for other information to appear first in results. 
*	Works that mention the reference number in other fields should follow the exact match in the search results 


## Examples: 

*	Botany, 16th Century
