# --- Configuration ---
# Use committer date (c) or author date (a). ISO 8601 format (I).
# %cI: committer date, ISO 8601 format (recommended for "when integrated")
# %aI: author date, ISO 8601 format (when originally written)

# --- Main Logic ---
# Get the specified date of the last commit affecting the folder path.

# and check the exit code and output.
