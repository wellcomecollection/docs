# People at Wellcome Collection

We have a set of processes we follow across the team to help facilitate people's learning and growth.

We aim to keep this process light and people focussed by [meeting often](./1-1s.md), and using [feedback](./feedback.md)
to discuss how we might support people achieving their [objectives](./objectives.md).

[Focusing on a person's achievements](./logbooks.md) and searching for opportunities
internally and externally to the organisation we aim to align [these objectives](./objectives.md)
with the organisation's vision.
