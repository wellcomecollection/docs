# Glossary

**Archivematica** - [A tool for born-digital workflows](https://www.archivematica.org/en/). We use Archivematica to package (+metadata) born-digital content,

**Digirati** - [An agency](https://digirati.com/) who create/maintain DLCS and contribute to the IIIF standards, who did a lot of the work on wellcomelibrary.org and also helped with our identity/requesting functionality.

**DLCS** - [Our image/IIIF server](https://dlcs.info/), run by Digirati.

**Encore** - [The "frontend" for Sierra](https://www.iii.com/products/encore/), which has historically been used on wellcomelibrary.org. This provides search and other user-facing interfaces; much of our work has been to replace it. 

**Goobi** - [Software for digitisation projects](https://www.intranda.com/en/digiverso/goobi/goobi-overview/). The digital production team use Goobi for packaging (+ metadata) digitised content.

**Intranda** - [The agency](https://www.intranda.com/) who maintain Goobi. They are based in Germany.

**IIIF** - [A set of standards for image data](https://iiif.io/). All of our images (from MIRO or via METS files) are exposed using IIIF APIs, which at their simplest can allow users to select the size, rotation, crop etc of an image; they can also expose metadata for images in context.

**MARC** - [A data format for library-related data](https://www.loc.gov/marc/). Both the format and the use of specific fields is standardised. MARC was created by the Library of Congress - in the 1960s!

**METS** - [A standard for metadata for digitised content](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/). Our new (post-MIRO) digitised content has metadata stored in METS files, and it also has catalogue records in Sierra.

**MIRO** - The system which stored the data for wellcomeimages.org, now frozen and subsumed into our services. 

**OPAC, the** - An older and more limited frontend for Sierra, kind of equivalent to Encore. Comes "in the box" with Sierra, rather than being a separate product like Encore. Sometimes known as WebPAC.

**Sierra** - [Our Library Management System](https://www.iii.com/products/sierra-ils/). Sierra manages catalogue records, patrons and more. It exposes a pretty good API which is [well documented](https://techdocs.iii.com/sierraapi/Content/titlePage.htm).
